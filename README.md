# The Poetry of Frequency: Using Voyant in English Pedagogy, Revision, and Beyond!

Welcome! To get started, go to https://voyant-tools.org to open Voyant's start page OR download a local version called VoyantServer using these instructions: https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/server

Not sure whether or not to use VoyantServer? The difference between the two is that VoyantServer is a locally-hosted server, whereas Voyant is web-based. If you are concerned about the privacy of your work and uploading unpublished prose or poetry to a non-local server, VoyantServer is the better option for you, as everything is stored on your personal computer. For our workshop's purposes, since we are using work that is in the public domain, it may not be necessary to download VoyantServer, but you may do so if you choose.
